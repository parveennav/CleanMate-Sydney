                <h3 class="pricing-detailed-title">Factors Affecting Commercial Cleaning Costs</h3>
                <p class="pricing-detailed-intro">
                    Several key factors influence commercial cleaning pricing in Sydney. <span class="pricing-detailed-highlight">Facility size</span> is the primary consideration – larger spaces naturally cost more but benefit from volume discounts. <span class="pricing-detailed-highlight">Cleaning frequency</span> significantly impacts pricing, with daily service offering better per-visit rates than weekly or monthly cleaning.
                </p>
                <p class="pricing-detailed-intro">
                    <span class="pricing-detailed-highlight">Scope of services</span> affects cost considerably. Basic office cleaning (trash removal, vacuuming, dusting) costs less than comprehensive programs including carpet cleaning, window washing, and specialized sanitization. After-hours service may include a premium, typically 10-20% above standard rates, to accommodate businesses requiring evening or overnight cleaning.

									<h2>Remon Sulaiman</h2>
									<p>
										We run a busy restaurant and the exhaust system is always working overtime. HygieneXperts came in after hours and did a full clean of our rangehood, duct, and fans. Honestly, I was blown away – everything looks brand new and the airflow has improved a lot. They worked quickly without disrupting the kitchen, and even gave us compliance paperwork which makes life easier with council checks. Really happy with the service and will definitely be booking them regularly.

									<p>
										Our kitchen hadn’t had a proper deep clean in months and it really showed. Akash and his team came in and completely transformed it. From the floors to the walls, equipment, and hard-to-reach areas, everything was cleaned to a very high standard. The team were polite and professional, and gave us peace of mind with hygiene and safety. We will definitely be using them regularly.
